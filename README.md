# About This Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding PHP authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). It provides a collection of code examples and demonstrations crafted specifically for educational purposes.

## Inclusion of `.env` File and `vendor` Folder

### Visibility of `.env` File
The presence of the `.env` file within this repository is intended solely for educational purposes. In real-world scenarios, it is standard practice to safeguard sensitive information, such as database credentials and API keys, by excluding them from version control. However, for educational intents, exposing the `.env` file allows learners to grasp the utilization of environment variables in configuring applications.

### Inclusion of `vendor` Folder
Similarly, the inclusion of the `vendor` folder, housing Composer dependencies, serves educational purposes exclusively. In practical application, it is advisable to omit the `vendor` folder from version control to maintain manageable repository sizes and to prevent sharing extraneous dependencies.

## Repository Contents

- **Source Code**: Contains PHP files illustrating authentication mechanisms, database interactions, and error handling.
- **README**: Provides essential information about the repository, including usage instructions and guidelines.
- **.env File**: Includes environment variables necessary for configuring the application environment.
- **Vendor Folder**: Contains third-party dependencies managed by Composer.

The project comes with preinstalled packages such as the `vlucas/phpdotenv` for adding environmental variables library and Composer. To learn more about their installation, refer to the provided links:

- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## Setting Up a Web Server

This project is compatible with any web server of your choice. However, for demonstration purposes, we recommend using XAMPP. You can download and install XAMPP from the following link:

Remember, you are not limited to XAMPP or MAMP. Feel free to use any web server and database management system that suits your preferences and requirements.

## Note on Security

While exposing sensitive information and large files in a repository is acceptable for educational purposes, it is crucial to emphasize that this practice should never be replicated in personal or official projects. Exposing sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, or other confidential data, poses significant security risks and can lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.

Always follow best practices and safe coding principles when working on real-world projects. This includes keeping sensitive information secure, adhering to version control best practices, and regularly reviewing and updating security measures to protect against potential threats.

By adhering to best practices and exercising caution, we can ensure the security and integrity of our projects while leveraging valuable learning opportunities provided by repositories like this one.
